# Weather App using React.js

A weather app project is a project that uses React.js, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to forecast the weather. The app can provide information such as the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and cloud cover. The app can also predict whether the day will be cloudy or sunny.
To build a weather app, you need to use an API (Application Programming Interface). An API allows applications to interact and share data. You can use a variety of components and microservices to fetch weatherÂ information.
